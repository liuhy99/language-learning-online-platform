<h1 align="center">Online Language learning Platform Using SSH Framework</h1>

### :page_facing_up: Introduction

Due to the impact of the 2020 epidemic, more and more people choose to study online. Self-study faces the difficulties of scattered materials and it is difficult for one person to persist for a long time. Therefore, the idea came to me to design and develop an online language learning communication platform for self-study students to obtain information and communicate with each other.

The overall design and development: 

JAVA is used as the programming language, B/S architecture is used as the system architecture, MVC mode and SSH framework are used to implement the layered operation of this platform, JSP and other technologies are used to develop the program, SQL Sever 2014 is used as the database, and Tomcat is used to deploy and run the program.
